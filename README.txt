This is a database application with a GUI made with Python, Sqlite3, and the Tkinter module.

In order to run this code you must have Python and the PILLOW package installed on your machine.

This is the first programming project that I ever worked on, and I am working on a new version that is more structurally
sound; follows python coding standards; and uses better database practices such as incorporating relational data tables.

I also removed the actual database file and made a smaller database for demonstration purposes, but this code does work
with over 200 entries into the database.

In order to access an individual record within the database, you must press "Access Records" on the main menu, search
for a record on the search window, then enter the ID number listed in a books results in the "Please select a record"
entry box in the top right of the window, then press "Access Record". This will allow you to see the full details and
edit the record.
